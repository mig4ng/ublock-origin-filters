# ublock-origin-filters
My uBlock Origin filters to remove unnecessary distractions from some websites.

For each website I have very specific tasks I do.
I optimize for allowing those tasks, while disabling everything else that might distract me.

These are my preferences, feel free to use the filters directly from this repository or fork them.

If I miss anything or you think I would benefit from something else, open an issue, pull request or send me an email (my github username at gmail.com).

## How to use/install

Add the `0-include-all.txt` file to your imports.

Click the extension, then the open the dashboard in the gears (click `More` to see it). Go to `Filter Lists > Import...` and add the following link:

```

### Google account popup

Disable annoying Google popup that plages many websites.

### YouTube

**Objective:** Remove all distractions, recommended videos, auto-play, suggestions (everywhere), shorts. Most of the time I only want to:

*Note:* Right now I am using Unhook (the Firefox extension). It works well but it might be possible to replace it with a filter too (https://letsblock.it/filters).

- see the tweet feed in a specific profile I have opened;
- see a tweet content and it's comments;
